```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

PCA allows you to see the overall "shape" of the data, identifying which samples are similar to one another and which are very different. This can enable us to identify groups of samples that are similar and work out which variables make one group different from another.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
